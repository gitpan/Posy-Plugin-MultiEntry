Revision history for Posy-Plugin-MultiEntry
===========================================

0.03 Sat 23 July 2005
---------------------

  * (23 Jul 2005) complete revamp
  	This has been changed around completely to be simpler and more
  straightforward; instead of trying to do special things with the entry
  which triggers multi-entry behaviour, everything is treated just as if
  we were in a category path, and the path-type is changed to 'category'
  in keeping with this (and the config vars are re-set).
  	Also added multi_entry_exclude and multi_entry_include config
  variables, to be able to filter the entries selected.  Thus one can
  use this to display a sub-set of the entries for the current category,
  based in their filenames.
